    <h1>Design System Journey - For a Better Mental Health!</h1>
    <p>
      Im 59 and my <strong>bucket-list</strong> contains an item to create a 
      <strong><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-systems-101/">
      design system</a></strong> from scratch, which may strike most as odd. 
      The desire to accomplish such an arduous task came to me while working 
      at <a href="https://emyth.com">EMyth</a> from 2014-2016. This was the 
      first time I worked with a designer, an incredible young man who 
      impressed me with his ability to balance elagance and pragmatic apeal 
      equally. He also proved to be unbearably abnoxious as his opinions 
      and input felt like they were being thrust upon me, hmmm, thinking about 
      it over the years has made me realize it was me not him.  I hadn't 
      recognized my envy, jelousy, and sadness that I wasn't as good as he was.
      And designer was just one of three other roles he had in the company, a 
      very talented young man indeed. <strong><em> But at the time I hadn't 
      realized it was me, not him</em></strong>

      I find the idea of creating a design system from scratch very interesting, even though
      it's not my strongest abilities, actually I find it very confusing, but still something 
      deep in me wants to be good at it. Then about the time I turned 50, a thought occured to
      me, if I haven't taken the time invest and learn, especially since I've been totally 
      capable of committing the time and energy, then when the hell am I going to.  
      
      But something in me tugged away, designer + enginee equally... Lofty indeed. Then it 
      started jostling around up in my brain and I asked the question, why haven't I became 
      a designer after all the time and energy I've but into learning it... I was embarrased 
      "embarrased" then I started working on why I was embarrased, which led me to finally 
      seek out help for my mental health. Another story another time, now back onto design 
      systems.

      I have spent many many many hours reading, doing tutorials, or watching a talk trying
      to gain education As I've worked with a number of third party tools, my primary motivation was to 
      "Pretend" to know more than I do and to more quickly get things done. It wasn't 
      for years, before I realized I never took the time to truly understand and 
      <strong>Own</strong> the knowledge contained in Mozilla Developers Network (MDN)
    </p>
    <p>I also had a strong desire to be better than anyone, and I used to actually believe that I could do it, so I spent tons of time digging into the introductions of many technologies, just to be able to "Act" like I know what I'm talking about, and then going home to do the work, only to find myself buried in learning what I pretended to know.</p>
    <p>It was the year I got out of the Navy, about 9 months before my time to get out someone pointed out that the navy has a program to help transistion their enlisted people back into civilian life</p>
